# COMP2101 Embedded Systems Programming

Kepler short-course on the fundamentals of microcontroller programming and architecture.

Development of this course is underway; you can follow our progress alternating Friday mornings at 9am CDT at www.tsog.tv. Next stream is 9/13/19.

The focus of this course is to teach students how to work with microcontrollers such as the AVR architecture microcontrollers found in Arduino devices. Students who have completed this course should understand the basics of microcontroller architecture and be able to create simple, practical software in a professional programming environment.

### Notes from first Standing Meeting (8/30/19):
Discussed the initial lesson in-depth and how it will impact the remainder of the course. Decided to focus on development in Visual Studio Code to allow students to explore the built-in libraries used by the Arduino platform.

Mr. Dugie walked through the setup process to get a simple "Blink" program running in this interface.

**Action items:**

Mr. Dugie - Type up process of setting up Visual Studio Code and the Blink program for the lesson 1 worksheet.

Dr. F - Write up an introduction to microcontrollers based on the previously written slide deck.
